This programm was written as a product of a challenge. Link to the challenge: https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/object-oriented-principles 
This challenge taught me few things: firstly is base of OOP. I learned how to write classes and use different modules. Secondly, is how to create your own game with Python. Also now I am aware with some points with make my code cleaner and better.
